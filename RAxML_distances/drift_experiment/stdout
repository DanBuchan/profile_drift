RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

Alignment has 150 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 0.00%

RAxML Computation of pairwise distances

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
